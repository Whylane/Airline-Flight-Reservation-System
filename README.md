## Airline Flight Reservation System

## Description

The Ailine Flight Reservation System was developed for BSTM students enrolled in Pangasinan State University, Alaminos City Campus, for them to use in their BSTM curriculum. Its primary objective was to provide students with the necessary skills and familiarity with system management. The system was just a simulation that provided a user-friendly interface that integrated essential functionalities, allowing users to search for available flights, book flights, manage cancellations, select seats, handle overbooking situations, provide compensation when necessary, and generate complete booking summaries, all while efficiently managing reservations.
